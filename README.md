# React Endpoint Renderer ðŸ§ª

Render your endpoints on the fly with React. 

## Synopsis

Perhaps, your code is always perfect. Perhaps, your endpoint types and shapes are always exactly as designed. Perhaps your data shapes and calculations are always what you expect after various transformations. If so, React Endpoint Renderer is **not** for you! 

**React Endpoint Renderer** makes it easy to print out endpoints so that they can be tested easily. 

In slightly more detail, it's a [React portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) that prints a [tree data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)#:~:text=A%20tree%20data%20structure%20can,none%20points%20to%20the%20root.) of components expressing endpoints. From there, you can do what you'd likeâ€”but I recommend running tests on those endpoints! 

## Install

```sh
npm install react-endpoint-renderer
# or
yarn add react-endpoint-renderer
# or
pnpm install react-endpoint-renderer
```

## Usage

After installing React Endpoint Renderer, import it and use it to your liking.

It can be imported as a `default` or as the named component itself

```js
import EndpointRenderer from 'react-endpoint-renderer'
// or 
import { EndpointRenderer } from 'react-endpoint-renderer'
```

Because it renders in a React Portal, you can use (reference) it anywhere in your React app.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { EndpointRenderer } from 'react-endpoint-renderer'
import { SomeComponent } from './components/SomeComponent'

export const SomeParentComponent = () => {
  return (
    <SomeComponent>
      {/* 
        * You can use the EndpointRenderer within a component (like below) 
        * You can use variables to only render (show) the endpoint when you want
      */}
      {isWhiteListedHost && isRenderingEndpoint && Object.keys(data).length > 0 && <EndpointRenderer endpoint={data} />}
    </SomeComponent>
  )
}

export default SomeParentComponent
```

Here's a quick pseudo code example/idea

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { EndpointRenderer } from 'react-endpoint-renderer'

export function SomeAwesomeEndpointSubmission({ isWhiteListedHost }) {
  const isRenderingEndpoint = new URLSearchParams(search).get("isRenderingEndpoint")
  const [data, setData] = useState({});

  function handleSubmit async (endpoint) {
    const updatedData = await endpoind();
    setData(updatedData);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button type='submit' onClick={handClick}>Submit Endpoint</button>
      {isWhiteListedHost && isRenderingEndpoint && Object.keys(data).length > 0 && <EndpointRenderer endpoint={data} />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

And yes, you can use the EndpointRenderer to render data besides endpoints!

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { EndpointRenderer } from 'react-endpoint-renderer'
import { SomeComponent } from './components/SomeComponent'

export const SomeParentComponent = () => {
  return (
    <SomeComponent>
      {whatDataIsThis && Object.keys(whatDataIsThis).length > 0 && <EndpointRenderer endpoint={whatDataIsThis} />}
    </SomeComponent>
  )
}

export default SomeParentComponent
```

Hope to provide better documentation soon(ish)!
